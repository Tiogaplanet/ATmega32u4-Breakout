# ATmega32u4 Breakout
 A breakout board for the ATmega32u4, designed using KiCad.

# Features
 The ATmega32u4 comes in a 44-pin quad-flat no-leads (QFN) package or a thin quad flat pack (TQFP). This breakout board adapts the TQFP to make prototyping and integration with larger projects easy.  Every pin of the ATmega32u4 is pulled out to a breadboard-friendly size of 57.15mm x 18.86mm with 2.54mm pin spacing.  The result is an ATmega32u4 in a more conventional dual-inline package (DIP).  Solder pads for a 16MHz crystal and a pair of 22pF capacitors are included.
